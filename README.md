# graphql-java-spring-boot-example
Spring Boot Application implementing a GraphQL server and querying an internal H2 database using JOOQ.

# Running
To build the JOOQ schema generated from the schema.sql, execute this maven command:

```$ mvn clean generate-sources -Pgenerate```

This will generate the tables in the gensrc directory.

To run the Spring Boot Application itself, execute `com.example.DemoGraphQL.DemoGraphQlApplication`.

Access graphql by visiting [http://localhost:8080/graphql](http://localhost:8080/graphql) in e.g. POSTMAN or visit [http://localhost:8080/graphiql](http://localhost:8080/graphiql) for the graphiql browser interface.

# Sample queries:

```javascript
{
  findAllBooks{
    title
    isbn
    id
    pageCount
    author{
      id
      firstName
      lastName
    }
  }
}
```
Will yield all books (with their title, isbn, id and pageCount) as well as their author (with their id, first and last name).


```javascript
{
  findBooks(where:{
    and:[
      {in:["id","10","20","30","60"]},
    	{or:[
        {eq:["Author.id","1"]},
        {like:["title","Illum%"]}
      ]}
    ]
  }, options:{
    orderBy: ["Author.id", "ASC", "Book.isbn", "DESC"],
    limit: 2
  }) {
    id
    title
    isbn
    author{
      id
      firstName
      lastName
    }
  }
}
```

Will yield all books (with id, title, isbn and author (with id, first and last name)) WHERE ID IN (10, 20, 30, 60) AND (Author.id = 1 OR title LIKE Illum%) ordered by Author.id in ascending and by Book.isbn in descending order and limited to two books.
